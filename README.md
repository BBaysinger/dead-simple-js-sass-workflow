# dead-simple-js-sass-workflow
Dead simple barebones use for JS and SASS, with sourcemaps and watch. Great for prototyping with vanilla ES6.

I plan to add branches for similar flows through other tools (Gulp, Browserify, etc...), each with ES6 and TypeScript. A lot can be learned through simplest use cases.

Please LMK if there are ways to simplify any aspects further, like making use of defaults.
